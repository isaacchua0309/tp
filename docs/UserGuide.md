```

**Example**:
```
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, #01-01 t/bestfriend s/tennis pc/123456
```

This adds John Doe to your contacts with his details and shows he plays tennis.

![Adding a Friend](images/add_command.png)

> 💡 **Postal Code Tip**: The postal code lets FitFriends calculate proximity for meetups at sports venues. Only valid postal codes are accepted.

> 💡 **Sports Tip**: Only valid sports from our database are accepted. Popular sports like basketball, tennis, soccer, etc. are supported.

> 💡 **Tags Tip**: Tags are optional. You can add as many tags as you want to a contact (e.g., `t/bestfriend t/colleague`). Tags help you categorize your contacts.

#### Listing All Friends

View all your sports buddies in one place.

**Format**:
```
list
```

This displays all your friends in the left panel.

![Listing All Friends](images/list_command.png)

> 💡 **List Tips**:
> * You should run this command after adding, deleting or editing friends to see the updated list.
> * You should also run this command after running find or findsport commands to view the full list.

#### Editing a Friend

Update your friend's details as they change.

**Format**:
```
edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] [pc/POSTALCODE]
```

**Example**:
```
edit 2 n/James Lee p/87654321 a/45 Sunset Blvd pc/018907
```

This updates the 2nd person in your current list with a new name, phone number, address, and postal code.

![Editing a Friend](images/edit_command.png)

> ⚠️ **Note**: You cannot edit sports with this command. To change sports information, use the `deletesport` and `addsport` commands.

> 💡 **Editing Tip**: Editing a tag will remove all existing tags as tags cannot be added sequentially (e.g., `edit t/bestfriend` followed by `edit t/colleague` will result in only the `colleague` tag remaining).

#### Locating Friends by Name

Quickly find friends by searching for part of their name.

**Format**:
```
find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]
```

**Example**:
```
find james jake
```

This will show all contacts whose names contain "James" or "Jake".

![Finding Friends](images/find_command.png)

> 💡 **Search Tips**:
> - Searches are case-insensitive
> - Order of keywords doesn't matter
> - Only full words are matched (e.g., "Han" won't match "Hans")
> - Any contact matching at least one keyword will be shown

> 💡 **Pro-tip**: If you run edit, delete, addsport, deletesport commands immediately after this command, these commands will apply to the contact listed at the index as shown by the find command. Use this to manage your contacts without having to search for them manually!
